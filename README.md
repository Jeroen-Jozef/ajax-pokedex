## Ajax pokédex

##### Information
This project is based off pokeapi. In the API we fetch the id, the name, all moves and the previous evolution, if at least there is one. In the search fiels we can use the id or the name, the search button shows the id, the sprite of the pokemon and the previous evolution. The first four moves are shown at the first click, but we can look up other moves by ckicking the button again.

##### Bugs and Extras
This might well be a work in coninuous progress, which would reflect the "evoltution" of pokemon itself.
